# Ruby Inception
Ruby is an interpreted dynamic language. It belongs to the family of scripting language. 
Development is fast and easy. It is thoroughly object oriented. Every entity is an object. 
It supports multiple inheritance, called **mixins** in Ruby. It is dynamically typed. Sometimes, this feature adds to 
bad-reputation for slow processing but this is not the case with Ruby. It has modern programming language features like lexical 
closures, iterators, first class continuations. Everything is an expression and is evaluated immediately.
It includes an iteractive REPL shell for interpreting. The centralized package managemement system call RubyGems. 
It has large standar library with modules for Web programming, GUI programming, OpenSSL and JSON. 

### Running Ruby programs
open command prompt and run **irb**. This will launch the interative ruby shell.
