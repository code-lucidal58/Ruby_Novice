# Ruby Inception
Ruby is an interpreted dynamic language. It belongs to the family of scripting language.
Development is fast and easy. It is thoroughly object oriented. Every entity is an object. 
It supports multiple inheritance, called **mixins** in Ruby. It is dynamically typed. 
Sometimes, this feature adds to bad-reputation for slow processing but this is not the case with Ruby. 
It has modern programming language features like lexical closures, iterators, first class continuations. 
Everything is an expression and is evaluated immediately. It includes an iteractive REPL shell for interpreting. 
The centralized package managemement system call RubyGems. It has large standar library with modules for Web 
programming, GUI programming, OpenSSL and JSON. 

### Running Ruby programs
Open command prompt and run **irb**. This will launch the interactive ruby shell. It is a read, eval, 
print loop i.e. the shell will read the statement, evaluate it, print the result, and then give the control 
back to the console. Ruby using indentation rather that braces for defining scopes. To exit the shell, type **quit()**. 
This will bring the control back to command prompt. The other way to execute ruby is by writing script in a 
file with .rb extension. To run this file, write in command prompt ```ruby hello.rb``` where hello.rb 
is the ruby script file.
