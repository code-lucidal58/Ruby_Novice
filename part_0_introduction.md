# Introduction 
Ruby is interpreted (does not need a compiler). It is a case-sensitive language. It does not require semicolon(:)
for termination. Ruby doesn't care about whitespace. Hence no need to worry about indentations.


It supports simple mathematical operations like: + - * / % **
There are two methods that are used to print on screen: _puts_ and _print_
. _print_ prints content as it is. _puts_ adds a new line to the content. There are no parentheses.
```ruby
print "Hello There"
puts "How are you?"
```
